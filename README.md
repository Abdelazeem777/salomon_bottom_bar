# salomon_bottom_bar

Yet another bottom navigation bar, but with a few key promises.

## Promises

1. We will meet the specifications provided by Aur√©lien Salomon and his gorgeous [Google Bottom Bar Navigation Pattern](https://dribbble.com/shots/5925052-Google-Bottom-Bar-Navigation-Pattern/).

2. We will be accessible.

3. We will mimic the semantics of [BottomNavigationBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html)

NOTE: Any use cases not covered by Salomon's specification are not guaranteed by this package.

## Contributing

Create an issue / pull-request when we are not keeping our promises, ie:

1. The package does not match the Salomon specification.
2. There is an accessibility problem.
3. It diverges from `BottomNavigationBar` semantics.
